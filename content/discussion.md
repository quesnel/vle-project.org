## Mailing lists

The mailing lists are the heart of the VLE community. This list is oriented
toward casual users of the VLE libraries, model developers or VLE developers.
It is a good place to start if you are having trouble getting started with VLE
or its individual package. Feel free to post both "newbie" and more challenging
questions. You can also post very technical, and oriented toward VLE library
developers. It is also read by many other members interested in watching the
VLE library development process. Virtually all VLE decisions, major or minor,
technical or otherwise, are reached via public discussion on this mailing list.

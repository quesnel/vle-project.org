# The VLE Project for dynamical system modeling and simultation

## Getting Started

The Virtual Laboratory Environment is a multi-modeling and simulation platform.
It is a powerful modeler and simulator supporting the use of different
formalisms for models specification and simulation.

VLE is particularly well adapted for complex models where the coupling of
different formalisms is required. In addition to the classical use of one
single formalism for modeling and simulation, VLE can integrate, i.e. couple,
heterogeneous formalisms in one coherent simulation model.

It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.
You can [download VLE](download) for [Unix](download/linux),
[MacOS](download/apple) or [Windows](download/windows).
